Building rulebase distributions
-------------------------------

NOTES:  The system used to build rulebase distributions must have "make"
        software installed.

Concepts
--------

  The monitoring package provides rulebases for monitoring the UTi 
  infrastructure i.e all software and hardware platforms. (Or at least aims to
  do that at some stage) 

  Not all machines will have the same monitoring requirement.  The mechanism 
  for building rulebase distributions must be flexible enough to
  easily build custom distributions. 

  The monitoring package provides a mechanism based on "make".  The Makefile 
  provided contains many different targets that can be combined to build a 
  custom rulebase distribution.


Makefile targets
----------------

  This section desribes all the targets in the monitoring Makefile:

    pb_only:  Adds the PB_BasicMonitor rulebase to the distribution. This 
              enables tracking of webserver logs, portal logs and monitoring of
              webserver availability.

    pb_jndi_only:  Adds the PB_JNDIServerMonitor rulebase to the distribution.
                   This enables tracking of JNDI Server logs and monitoring of
                   JNDI Server availability.

    pb_db_only:  Adds PB_DatabaseServerMonitor rulebase to the distribution.
