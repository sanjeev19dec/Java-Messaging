Deployment and installation of custom adapters
----------------------------------------------

NOTES:  * Windows users can use pscp and putty for secure shell and secure copy
          access to machines:

        * The adapters require Java 1.4 to run.

1.  Adapter installer directory structure
-----------------------------------------

  Adapter installers are either .tar.gz files or .zip files containing  at least
  the following directory structure:

    uti/<adapter_dir>/bin
    uti/<adapter_dir>/deploy
    uti/<adapter_dir>/doc
    uti/<adapter_dir>/instance1/bin
    uti/<adapter_dir>/instance1/etc
    uti/<adapter_dir>/instance1/lib
    uti/<adapter_dir>/instance1/log
    uti/<adapter_dir>/src

  where "adapter_dir" is the name of your adapter e.g eservices or ds.

  See the building.txt file for instructions on creating distributions


2. Adapter user 
---------------

  Adapters are installed and run as the utisoft user on unix platforms.  

  The utisoft user details are as follows:

    Home:  /opt/uti
    passwd:  utisoft

  The following environment must be set for the utisoft user:

    # utisoft environment.

    #
    # TIBCO Environment
    #
    TIB_RV_HOME=/opt/tibco/tibrv
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$TIB_RV_HOME/lib

    export TIB_RV_HOME LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    #
    # Java Environment (Only add this if the system does not have Java 1.4)
    #
    JAVA_HOME=$HOME/jre/j2re

    export JAVA_HOME

    #
    # PATH (Only add this if the system does not have Java 1.4)
    #
    PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

    export PATH

    

3.  Initial adapter install
---------------------------

  To install an adapter for the first time:

    * Secure copy your adapter distribution to the target host:

        scp <my_dist>.tar.gz utisoft@<target_host>:

    * Secure shell to the target host and unpack the distribution:

        ssh -l utisoft <target_host>
        cd ../
        gunzip uti/<my_dist>.tar.gz
        tar xfv uti/<my_dist>.tar

    * Make the required configuration changes to all configuration files in the
      etc directory of your distribution. (instance1/etc)

    * Make .bak files of all the configuration files you changed and make sure
      that they are contained in the "Copy configs" section of the deployment
      script.  This is so that your configurations are maintained during adapter
      upgrades.

    * Create additional instances if you configured your adapter to run as a 
      distributed queue. (This is only if you want to run the DQ on one box)

        cd uti/<adapter_dir>/deploy 
        ./createinstance.sh 2 1
        ./createinstance.sh 3 1

      This will create instance 2 and 3 of your adapter and make them both 
      active.
   
    * Start your adapter:

        cd /opt/uti/<adapter_dir>/bin
        ./startall

    * To verify that the adapter started:

        ./monitor

      if you created three instances the output should look something like this:

        instance1 up
        instance2 up
        instance3 up


4.  Adapter upgrade or reinstall
-------------------------------- 

  To upgrade or reinstall an adapter:

    * Secure copy your adapter distribution to the target host:

        scp <my_dist>.tar.gz utisoft@<target_host>:

    * Secure shell to the target host:
      
        ssh -l utisoft <target_host>
    
    * Stop the running adapter instances:

        cd <adapter_dir>/bin
        ./stopall 

    * Execute the deploy script:

        cd ../deploy
        ./deploy.sh 

    * Create additional adapter instances:
        
        ./createinstance.sh 2 1
        ./createinstance.sh 3 1

      This will create instance 2 and 3 of your adapter and make them both 
      active.

    * Start the new adapter:

        cd ../bin
        ./startall
    
    * To verify that the adapter started:

        ./monitor

      if you created three instances the output should look something like this:

        instance1 up
        instance2 up
        instance3 up
