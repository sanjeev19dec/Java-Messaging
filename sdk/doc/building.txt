Building custom adapter distributions
-------------------------------------

  This document describes the building process for custom adapters from the 
  adapter sources.


Accessing the build environment
-------------------------------

  * A linux machine has been configured to serve as a build environment for 
    custom adapters.  

      Host: impala.pta.za.go2uti.com
      username:  utisoft
      password:  utisoft

  * To access the machine you require an ssh client like OpenSSH (for UNIX) or 
    PuTTY (for Windows)

  
Obtaining and compiling adapter sources
---------------------------------------

  * All adapter sources are stored and managed in the perforce depot.  The depot
    is located at:

      git5.pta.za.go2uti.com:1666

    The adapter sources are located in the //depot/nextgen directory.

  * SSH to impala as the utisoft user and access the src/uti directory:

      ssh -l utisoft impala 
      cd src/uti

  * Get all head revisions from perforce:

      p4 sync

  * Make sure the sdk core classes are compiled:

      cd sdk
      make clean
      make  

  * Compile your adapter:

      cd ../<adapter_dir>
      make clean
      make

    Your adapter distribution should be located in a file named as follows:

      uti_<adapter_dir>.tar.gz

  * See the deployment.txt file for instructions on deployment and installation.
