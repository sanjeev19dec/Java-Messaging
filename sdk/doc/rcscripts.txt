Configuring custom adapter startup on UNIX
------------------------------------------

  All adapters come bundled with an init script named as follows:

    init<adapter_name>

  It is located in the bin directory of your adapter installation:

   <utisoft_home>/<adapter_name>/bin

  To install the init script the following commands must be executed as root:

    cp init<adapter_name> /etc/init.d
    cd /etc/rc3.d
    ln -s ../init.d/init<adapter_name> init<adapter_name>
    cd ../rc0.d
    ln -s ../init.d/init<adapter_name> init<adapter_name>
